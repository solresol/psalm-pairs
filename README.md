# psalm-pairs
Pairwise similarity and alternative sequencing of the Psalms, with cross‑tradition numbering maps (MT ↔ LXX/Vulgate).

# What it does

It walks through every pair of Psalms and asks the following question:

	Consider Psalm X and Psalm Y (reproduced below). What arguments 
	could you make to justify that Psalm Y follows on from Psalm X?
	Consider stylistic similarities, similarities of vocab or ideas,
	connections to sequences of events common in ancient Israel life
	mythology or history.

Having done that, a separate process then rates the arguments on a scale
of 0 (very weak) to 10 (very strong).
